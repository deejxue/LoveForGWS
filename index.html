						The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the great white, white pointer, white shark, or white death, is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans.  According to a 2014 study the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above previous estimates, making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known.

						The great white shark has no known natural predators other than the killer whale.[11] The great white shark is arguably the world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, including fish and seabirds.

						But the Great White Shark is not just a mindless predator looking to eat you when you enter the water.  I remember as a kid being scared to death by the movie JAWS, which is the introduction most people get to these creatures.  But what you watch on the big screen is the truth about these majestic and awesome animals.

The animal you meet can be very curious, it finds you very interesting. “Sometimes it’s coming into your space. You can’t just bolt. You have to react the same way they would: swim after the shark and show a threat. It’s a chess game. They make a move, you make a move, and sometimes the moves can become a tense situation. Yes, it’s dangerous, but they are not mindless killers.” Since giving up his job as an IT technician 16 years ago, the South African has studied the behaviour of great whites, with surprising findings. “In the beginning I was very afraid,” he says. “But they have a softer side that most people don’t get to see.” By diving outside a cage, Hardenberg’s team have captured footage of great whites greeting each other and communicating, as well as placidly interacting with humans....
